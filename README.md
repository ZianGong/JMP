Job Market Paper

Documentation of code used for my Job Market Paper: Subjective Health Shocks and Retirement Timing
The code is broken into three (3) parts: 

PART I (Stata): Grabs Health and Retirement Study data from local network and pre-processes data for estimation.
PART II (Matlab): Using Stata prepared data, estimate model parameters from data.
PART III (Stata): Combines input data with model estimates for analysis.
